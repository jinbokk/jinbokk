## About

I am a frontend engineer focused on **building scalable UI structures and making clear technical decisions** using React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

In an era where AI can generate code efficiently, I believe **feature implementation alone is no longer a differentiator**.  
What matters more is the ability to **experiment quickly, fail fast, recover, and iterate with clarity**.

I value maintainable architecture, predictable data flow, and pragmatic solutions that work under real-world constraints.

---

## How I Work

- Prefer rapid prototyping over perfect first implementations  
- Optimize for fast feedback, iteration, and recovery  
- Use AI as a productivity multiplier, acting as a **“smart supervisor”**  
- Make technical decisions based on context, not trends

## Experience

Having worked in an agency environment, I’ve been exposed to **projects with diverse goals, constraints, and timelines**.

This experience strengthened my ability to:
- Adapt quickly to different project contexts  
- Collaborate closely with planners, designers, and backend engineers  
- Set realistic scopes under tight deadlines  
- Make pragmatic technical decisions based on priority and feasibility

## Interests

I have an ongoing interest in **3D interactions and visual experiences**, which I explore as a side interest rather than a primary focus.
